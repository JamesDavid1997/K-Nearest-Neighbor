# K-Nearest-Neighbor
Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN Algorithm

The KNN algorithm is a robust and versatile classifier that is often used as a benchmark for more complex classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Despite its simplicity, KNN can outperform more powerful classifiers and is used in a variety of applications such as economic forecasting, data compression and genetics.

This is a basic program designed to introduce you to a simple and understandable, yet powerful classification algorithm called K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN).
This program is applied to predict breast cancer patients using real-world dataset to see exactly how it works.
The datasets were taken from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29" and the files also enclosed in the repository.
